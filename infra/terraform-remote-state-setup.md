# Terraform Remote State Setup - COMPLETED

## Overview
Successfully configured Terraform remote state management using AWS S3 and DynamoDB for the MLOps Taxi Prediction personal learning project.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. S3 Backend for State Storage
- **Bucket**: `mlops-taxi-prediction-terraform-state`
- **Region**: `eu-north-1`
- **Key**: `terraform.tfstate`
- **Encryption**: AES256 server-side encryption
- **Versioning**: Enabled for state history and recovery
- **Public Access**: Completely blocked for security

### 2. DynamoDB for State Locking
- **Table**: `terraform-state-lock`
- **Billing Mode**: PAY_PER_REQUEST (cost-optimized for personal project)
- **Hash Key**: `LockID` (string)
- **Purpose**: Prevents concurrent Terraform operations

### 3. Configuration Files
```
infra/
├── bootstrap/
│   └── main.tf                    # Bootstrap resources (S3 + DynamoDB)
├── main.tf                        # Main infrastructure with remote backend config
├── setup-remote-state.sh         # Automated setup script
└── variables.tf                   # Variable definitions
```

## Backend Configuration
The main `infra/main.tf` includes:
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "mlops-taxi-prediction-terraform-state"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "eu-north-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
  }
}
```

## Personal Project Optimizations
- Used basic AES256 encryption instead of KMS (cost savings)
- PAY_PER_REQUEST billing for DynamoDB (low usage)
- Essential security features only (no unnecessary complexity)
- Single region deployment (eu-north-1)

## Verification Steps Completed
1. ✅ S3 bucket created and properly configured
2. ✅ DynamoDB table created and active
3. ✅ Terraform backend initialized successfully
4. ✅ No local state files remain
5. ✅ Versioning and encryption verified

## Current Status
- **Remote state**: Fully operational
- **State locking**: Enabled and working
- **Security**: Appropriate for personal project
- **Cost**: Optimized for learning/experimentation

## Next Steps
The remote state infrastructure is complete and ready for use. Future Terraform operations will:
- Store state remotely in S3
- Use DynamoDB for state locking
- Maintain state history through versioning
- Provide secure, consistent state management

## Usage
All standard Terraform commands now work with remote state:
```bash
cd infra/
terraform plan    # State read from S3
terraform apply   # State updated in S3 with locking
terraform destroy # State updated in S3 with locking
```

The setup is complete and the remote state backend is fully functional.
